    wilful misconduct and gross negligence. For simple negligence, the Provider shall
    only be liable if its vicarious agents or statutory representatives breach an
    obligation which is of key significance for the achievement of the objective of
    the contract (a so-called key obligation). In such a situation, the liability
    shall be limited to the foreseeable damage or loss, which is limited to the amount
    of the fee paid by the User for the use of the App or services and functions requiring
    registration. The above limitation of liability does not apply to claims under
    the German Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz) or to personal injuries.
    However, insofar as the Provider\u2019s liability is excluded or limited, this
    also applies to the personal liability of its statutory representatives and vicarious
    agents.\n\n## 10.4\n\nWe shall not participate in dispute settlement proceedings
    before a consumer arbitration board.\n\n## 11. Rules of conduct for users\n\n##
    11.1.\n\nThe User is not permitted to load, store, disseminate, present, make
    publicly available, publish or refer or set up links to any content with the aid
    of the App which could infringe or impair the personal rights and/or protective
    rights of third parties and/or:\n\nis obscene, insulting, defamatory or offensive,
    glorifies violence or is pornographic or harasses other users or is unsuitable
    for minors or racist, seditious, xenophobic, of an extreme right-wing nature or
    otherwise objectionable, and/or contains or describes viruses, trojans, circumvention
    devices as defined by the German Act for Conditional Access Services (Zugangskontrolldienstegesetz)
    or unsolicited bulk mail (known as \u201Cspam\u201D), and/or serves the purpose
    of and/or is suitable for extracting, storing or passing on personal data to other
    members for purposes other than the intended use of the services, and/or invites
    users to participate in chain letters, pyramid schemes or free share schemes and/or
    pursues commercial or other promotional purposes.\n\n## 11.2.\n\nThe User may
    only set up one account in the App (\u201Cprohibition of multi-accounts\u201D).
    In particular, one account must not be used to obtain benefits for another account
    of the same User, for example through the transfer of items or game currency credits
    within the game from one account to another account of the same user (\u201Cprohibition
    of pushing\u201D).\n\n## 11.3.\n\nThe use of the App is only permitted through
    tools provided or explicitly permitted by the Provider (\u201Cprohibition of the
    use of unauthorised scripts\u201D). This entails, in particular, that the use
    of programmes which generate an excessive load on the server is not permitted.
    The use of software to systematically or automatically control the App or individual
    game functions (bots, macros) or for the reproduction or analysis of the games,
    game elements or the content uploaded into the App is not permitted.\n\n## 12.
    Changes to the Terms of Use and the App\n\nThe Provider reserves the right to
    amend these Terms of Use. The Provider shall inform the User of the change by
    e-mail at least two weeks in advance. The changes shall be deemed to have been
    accepted by the User if he/she fails to object to those changes by e-mail to more.games.discovery@gmail.com
    within a period of one month after the receipt of the change notification. The
    Provider shall advise the User in the e-mail notifying him/her of the changes
    of the significance of the four-week time limit and the legal consequences of
    his/her failing to object. In the event that the User objects to the changes,
    the Provider reserves the right to terminate the usage contract in accordance
    with section 2.1 of these Terms of Use. Any legal acts carried out before the
    change shall continue to be subject to the original Terms of Use.\n\n## 13. Data
    protection\n\nUnless the User has explicitly agreed to more extensive processing
    and use, the Provider shall only process and use personal data provided upon registration
    insofar and as long as this is permitted by law, in particular to make the services
    and functions requiring registration available. More detailed information about
    the handling of User\u2019s personal data can be found in the privacy notice and,
    if appropriate, in a declaration of consent to be confirmed prior to active use
    of the App.\n\n## 14. Final provisions\n\n## 14.1 Server time\n\nIf a date and/or
    time are applicable for declarations and legal transactions, the displayed server
    date and the displayed server time of the App shall be decisive.\n\n## 14.2 Applicable
    law and place of jurisdiction\n\nSubstantive German law applies to the exclusion
    of choice of law rules. This also applies if the User accesses the App from outside
    Germany.\n\nThe place of jurisdiction for any claims related to an order is Hamburg,
    insofar as the User does not have either his/her place of residence or habitual
    residence in Germany but the registration in the App can be ascribed to the User\u2019s
    commercial and/or independent professional activities. The Provider has the right
    to also bring lawsuits in the User\u2019s general place of jurisdiction. Mandatory
    provisions of the EC Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments
    shall have precedence.\n\n## 14.3. Sub-service providers, takeover of the contract\n\nThe
    Provider has the right to either entirely or partially entrust third parties with
    the provision of the agreed services at any time. Furthermore, the Provider can
    transfer its rights and obligations under this contract to one or more third parties
    (takeover of the contract). In the event of a complete takeover of the contract,
    the User shall have the right to terminate the contract without notice.\n\n##
    14.4. Text form\n\nAny arrangements that deviate from these Terms of Use must
    be in text form in order to be effective. This also applies to any annulment of
    the requirement of written form.\n\n## 14.5. Severability clause\n\nShould a provision
    of these Terms of Use be or become ineffective, the effectiveness of the other
    provisions hereof shall not be affected. The ineffective or unenforceable provision
    shall be replaced by the parties by an effective provision which comes as close
    as possible to the commercial purpose of the ineffective or unenforceable provision.
    The same shall apply in the event of unintended gaps or omissions.\n\nAs of: January

  m_Text: "Terms\n\n# Terms of Use\n\nThese Terms of Use apply to any person (hereinafter
    referred to as the \u201CUser\u201D) who installs the This app (hereinafter referred
    to as the \u201CApp\u201D).\n\nThe This app is provided and operated by This App
    (hereinafter referred to as the \u201CProvider\u201D). You can find more detailed
    information on the Provider in the App\u2019s imprint.\n\n## 1. Registration,
    requirements for use, password\n\n## 1.1.\n\nThe App may be used free of charge
    following registration. You register by entering your e-mail address or through
    the single sign-on of Facebook or Google Plus, in the App\u2019s dialogue window
    or menu item provided for this purpose. You may register if:\n(a) you are over
    18 years of age and therefore have full legal capacity;\n(b) you fully and accurately
    fill in the required information requested upon registration; and\n(c) you do
    not yet have a user account for the App.\n\n## 1.2.\n\nBy completing and sending
    the registration form, the user applies for a user account for the App to be set
    up for him/her. When the Provider subsequently confirms or carries out the registration,
    a user relationship will be established, which authorises the user to use all
    of the App\u2019s services and functions.\n\n## 1.3.\n\nThe use of and registration
    in the App is only permitted for private purposes. There is no entitlement to
    registration or to the use of relevant services and functions of the App. The
    User must provide complete and correct information. Only one user account may
    be set up per user. Transferring or selling a user account to third parties for
    their own purposes is not permitted. E-mail addresses or self-selected user names
    must not have the potential to violate interests or rights of other users meriting
    protection or to breach laws.\n\n## 1.4.\n\nUpon registration, the password selected
    by the user will be assigned to his/her user account. The User must not disclose
    the password or make it available to third parties and must keep it in a safe
    place so as to avoid misuse. He/she must immediately inform the Provider if he/she
    has lost his/her password or if he/she learns that unauthorised third parties
    have gained knowledge of it. The User is liable for any misuse by third parties,
    unless he/she provides proof that it is not his/her fault..\n\n## 2. Term, termination
    and cancellation right\n\n## 2.1.\n\nRegistration in the App and the resulting
    possibility of making full use of the App is effective until termination, which
    can be declared by either the User or the Provider, giving one month\u2019s notice.\n\n##
    2.2.\n\nThe parties\u2019 right of extraordinary termination for good cause remains
    unaffected. Good cause exists for the Provider, in particular, if: (i) the User
    uses the App in breach of contract, particularly for commercial or improper purposes,
    or in breach of the rules of conduct set out in section 11 of these Terms of Use;
    (ii) the application for registration was incorrect or fraudulent.\n\n## 2.3.\n\nAny
    notice of termination must be in text form. The User can direct a notice of termination
    to the address of the Provider specified in the imprint. The Provider can direct
    a notice of termination to the e-mail address last specified by the User in the
    user account.\n\n## 2.4.\n\nAfter the end of the notice period for termination
    or when the user relationship between the user and the Provider otherwise ends,
    the right of the User to make further use of the services and functions of the
    App requiring registration shall expire. As a rule, after the end of the user
    relationship it will no longer be possible for the User to access data and content
    which were associated with the user account.\n\nCoins which the User has earned
    before the effective date of the termination may be redeemed up to six months
    after that date against a cash reward or other reward made available by the Provider
    in accordance with the provisions of section 5 of these Terms of Use. Thereafter,
    the coins shall expire and it will no longer be possible to redeem them. Upon
    the effectiveness of the termination by one of the parties, the user\u2019s right
    to collect coins in order to redeem them against rewards shall expire.\n\n## 2.5.\n\nThe
    User\u2019s statutory right to cancel the usage relationship established through
    the registration within two weeks from the activation of the user account by notice
    to the Provider remains unaffected.\n\n## 2.6.\n\nFollowing the termination or
    cancellation, the User shall be free to continue to use the preset Apps of the
    Provider\u2019s partner companies obtained by him/her.\n\n## 3. General specification\n\nThe
    App is an offer to present apps in all categories. It also enables the User to
    participate in a reward or bonus programme for the active use of game apps and
    other apps. Participation in the App solely serves the purpose of entertainment.
    The service provided by the App is to present to the User, possibly on the basis
    of his/her previous app preferences as well as his/her use and purchase behaviour
    with regard to such apps, games and other apps for the use of which the User can
    obtain coins via the App. The User earns coins through the active use of the apps
    of the Provider\u2019s partner companies preset in the App (hereinafter referred
    to as \u201Cpreset apps\u201D), as well as through the purchase of services and
    virtual items in the preset apps (in-app purchases).\n\nYou will find simple instructions
    for the use of the App when you first open it.\n\n## 4. Collecting coins\n\n##
    4.1.\n\nThe App offers users the possibility of collecting coins for the use of
    the preset apps.\n\nThe preset apps for which coins can be collected; the number
    of coins which can be earned per app; and the time and content limitation of special
    offers or special campaigns relating to individual coins and rewards are established
    solely by the Provider and can be changed by the Provider at any time without
    giving reasons. The User has no legal entitlement in this respect.\n\n## 4.2.\n\nCoins
    expire automatically one year after they have been credited to the User\u2019s
    App account, unless they have been previously redeemed against rewards.\n\n##
    5. Redeem coins and receive rewards\n\n## 5.1.\n\nUsers can redeem their coins
    for particular rewards according to an exchange rate established by the Provider
    for each reward. Examples of such rewards are PayPal credits, cash rewards or
    virtual rewards for other apps, credit codes or other digital content. The User
    can choose the rewards in the reward shop of the App. The User can select any
    reward provided by the Provider for which he/she has collected a sufficient number
    of coins, unless stocks of the selected reward are exhausted.\n\n## 5.2.\n\nThe
    Provider shall transfer cash rewards into a regular bank or online account of
    the User (for example via PayPal). For this purpose, the User must specify his/her
    payment details in connection with the payment of the rewards (bank details, e-mail
    address and user name for his/her online account, if necessary). The Provider
    will store that information for future transactions.\n\n## 5.3.\n\nVirtual rewards
    may, for example, be in-app items which are gifted to the users in other apps.
    The virtual rewards may be granted to the User through various channels, including
    but not limited to e-mail, push notification, text message or only a click on
    a button.\n\n## 5.4.\n\nRewards for the coins may also be voucher codes which
    the users can redeem in other apps or shops. When redeeming the coins against
    a voucher, the Provider\u2019s performance is limited to the transfer of a credit
    code to the User by the Provider conferring on the User an entitlement to conclude
    a contract with the respective issuer of the voucher or the party which is specified
    as the provider of the service for the respective voucher, on the terms specified
    on the respective voucher. The Provider provides no warranty for the voucher partner\u2019s
    financial capacity or creditworthiness and does not owe the performances specified
    on the voucher. The voucher partner is solely responsible for the performance
    of that contract, including the handling of any warranty claims.\n\n## 5.5.\n\nFor
    the redemption of rewards, the exchange rate at the moment of redemption always
    applies. The Provider reserves the right to change and adjust the exchange rate
    on an ongoing basis. The user has no entitlement to the maintenance or granting
    of a particular exchange rate.\n\n## 5.6.\n\nThe Provider will continue to develop
    the App on an ongoing basis. The User has no entitlement to the maintenance of
    the App or the preset apps in the version existing upon the conclusion of the
    contract. The Provider therefore reserves the right to offer new features and
    functions at any time, particularly (but not exclusively) for the redemption of
    coins. In the course of the modification and further development of the App, the
    Provider also reserves the right to tie individual features to certain conditions
    (e.g. the achievement of a particular coin account balance or the performance
    of certain actions, for example further app installations) or to no longer offer
    them at all.\n\n## 5.7.\n\nThe Provider guarantees no profits to the User. In
    particular, the User shall not be entitled to be paid a particular reward. An
    entitlement to the payment of a reward only exists if such an entitlement has
    been explicitly offered by the Provider. The applicable exchange rate is that
    of the time of the redemption of the coins.\n\nThe User shall not be entitled
    to the payment or redemption of the reward if he/she violates the game rules or
    rules of conduct set out in section 11, particularly if he/she has technically
    manipulated the outcome of a game or the App itself.\n\n## 6. Fees\n\nThe use
    and registration of the App is free of charge. The Provider reserves the right
    to charge fees in the future for individual features. This may occur in particular,
    though not exclusively, for the activation of additional features within the App
    or the purchase of coins for further use in the App.\n\nThe User will be informed
    of this at least two weeks in advance. If he/she does not agree to the additional
    costs, the Provider shall have the right to terminate this usage contract, giving
    one month\u2019s notice, effective at the end of a month, in which case the User
    shall have the right to redeem the coins which he/she has already earned until
    the effective date of the termination within a further six months from the effective
    date of the termination.\n\n## 7. User\u2019s usage rights to content\n\n## 7.1.\n\nIf
    the User places texts, photographs or other content (hereinafter referred to jointly
    as \u201Ccontent\u201D) in the App or disseminates such content in the App (for
    example within the framework of his/her profile or through comment functions),
    he/she shall grant the Provider, free of charge, the right to store that content
    without any time limitation, to make it available free of charge for accessing
    in connection with the respective offer, to edit it, offer it for storage or printing
    or to use it in online, print, radio or other media. The content will only be
    published on the App. Any use for advertising purposes (e.g. advertisements) shall
    require the consent of the respective user. The rights can be granted to third
    parties by way of a sublicense, provided that such sublicensing serves the purpose
    of enabling the third party to provide services for the App in connection with
    the provision or use of the App. The above-mentioned rights shall remain with
    the Provider without any time limitation also after the usage contract has been
    terminated or otherwise ended.\n\n## 7.2.\n\nThe User warrants by uploading the
    content that he/she is able to dispose of the rights hereby granted, that no opposing
    third-party rights exist and that he/she has not yet otherwise disposed of the
    rights to the content which would preclude their being granted to the Provider
    in accordance with these Terms of Use. Persons under 18 years of age warrant that
    they have obtained the consent of their parents or guardians.\n\n## 7.3.\n\nThe
    Provider is not obliged to verify the correctness, completeness or legality of
    the User\u2019s content in advance. The Provider does not adopt the User\u2019s
    content as its own. The Provider shall not be liable for any damage or loss caused
    by the use of that content. If the Provider is informed of legal violations due
    to third-party or linked content, it shall delete or block the relevant content
    after examining the allegation of unlawfulness.\n\n## 7.4\n\nThe User shall indemnify
    the Provider against any justified third-party claims which are asserted against
    the Provider or companies affiliated with it, as defined by Article 15 et seq.
    of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz), or their statutory representatives
    and/or vicarious agents due to the use of the rights granted under section 7 or
    due to content distributed and made publicly available by the User on the App.
    The User shall fully reimburse the Provider for the judicial and extra-judicial
    costs incurred as a result of this by the Provider or its statutory representatives
    and/or vicarious agents.\n\n## 8. Rights to the content provided by the Provider\n\nThe
    content provided by the Provider on the App is protected under copyright and ancillary
    copyright law. Duplication, public reproduction or other use or utilisation of
    content which is thus protected requires the consent of the respective rights
    holder. The User is permitted to use, access, save and print out the content exclusively
    for the purposes of the contractual use of the App and for private use and provided
    that this is neither directly nor indirectly for commercial purposes.\n\n## 9.
    Availability, data backup\n\n## 9.1.\n\nThe Provider provides no guarantee that
    the App and the services and functions requiring registration operate and are
    available without interruption and errors at all times. The User must him/herself
    ensure an adequate Internet connection. The User is aware that, like any other
    software, the games and services can never be completely free of errors. The User
    is responsible him/herself for the fulfilment of the system requirements necessary
    for the use of the App, particularly with respect to the operating system used
    by it. However, the Provider shall make every effort, within the limits of what
    is commercially reasonable, to enable the operation of the App without interruptions
    or errors at all times.\n\n## 9.2.\n\nThe Provider can restrict the availability
    of and access to the App and services and functions requiring registration insofar
    as the security of the network operation and the maintenance of the network integrity,
    particularly the need to avoid serious disruptions of the network, the software
    or stored data, requires this.\n\n## 9.3\n\nThe Provider is not obliged to provide
    updates or upgrades for the App or to otherwise modify the App in line with possible
    changes made to hardware and/or software (particularly operating systems).\n\n##
    10 Warranty / liability\n\n## 10.1.\n\nIf the Provider learns that the App has
    errors which significantly impair its fitness for the contractual use, it shall
    endeavour to eliminate the errors as soon as possible, for example by providing
    an update. This does not include errors which do not lie within the Provider\u2019s
    area of responsibility, such as errors which occur due to updates in the android
    operating system.\n\n## 10.2.\n\nThe use of the preset apps shall be regulated
    exclusively by the usage relationship existing between the User and the Provider\u2019s
    partner company and any terms of use set by the partner company. It is explicitly
    left to the User to inform him/herself about the key issues governing his/her
    decision to conclude a contract or to agree to the partner company\u2019s Terms
    of Use.\n\nThe Provider shall not be the User\u2019s contract partner with regard
    to the use of the preset apps. The Provider shall not bear any liability for material
    or legal defects in this respect. The Provider shall also not be liable for the
    correctness, completeness and/or up-to-dateness of the content of the preset apps.
    The Provider does not adopt the content of those apps as its own and is not liable
    for any damage or loss caused by the use of those apps. The Provider also provides
    no guarantee for the partner company\u2019s services being performed correctly.\n"
